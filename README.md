# Turtlebot3_toolbox

Control Turtlebot 3 without ROS

I creat this repository because I found it really troublesome to control turtlebot3 with ROS if I only need to run it as a simple differential wheel platform.

I write some codes to control the OpenCR board with the Raspberry pi easily.

This repository won't be finished in a short time but I will try my best.
